🎥 Face Recognition Attendance System
An innovative Face Recognition-based Attendance System that uses deep learning to capture and recognize student faces, update attendance records in real-time using Firebase, and provide a user-friendly GUI for manual database management. This project is inspired by tutorials from Murtaza Hassan and Computer Vision Zone.

✨ Features
🎬 Real-Time Face Recognition: Detects and recognizes student faces in real-time using a webcam and deep learning techniques.
📊 Firebase Integration: Seamlessly stores and manages student data and attendance records using Firebase Realtime Database.
📈 Automatic Attendance Marking: Automatically updates attendance status in Firebase for recognized students.
🖥️ Manual Database Management GUI: Built with Tkinter, this GUI allows for easy addition, removal, and modification of student records.
📤 Export to Excel: Easily export student data to an Excel file for reporting and analysis.
📋 Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python Libraries: opencv-python, numpy, face_recognition, cvzone, firebase-admin, tkinter, pandas
Dlib and CMake: Install Visual Studio with Desktop Development with C++ to compile the necessary C++ libraries required by face_recognition.
A Firebase project with Realtime Database and Storage configured.
A valid serviceAccountKey.json file for Firebase authentication.
🚀 Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/face-recognition-attendance.git
cd face-recognition-attendance
Install the Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy face_recognition cvzone firebase-admin pandas
Firebase Configuration:

Place your serviceAccountKey.json file in the root directory. This is crucial for Firebase authentication.
If you encounter any issues setting up Firebase or generating the serviceAccountKey.json, refer to Murtaza Hassan's tutorial for step-by-step instructions.
Prepare Student Images:

Use .png format for all student images.
Name each image file according to the student's unique ID. This convention is essential for accurate identification.
Fill Data Manually:

Run the studentmanagement.py script to open the database management GUI.
Add each student's details manually once through this interface to ensure the data is correctly synchronized with Firebase.
Generate Encodings:

Run the following command to generate the facial encodings required for recognition:

bash
Copy code
python EncodeGenerator.py
This will create EncodeFile.p, containing all known student encodings.

📂 Running the Project
Run the Face Recognition System:

bash
Copy code
python Main.py
This script will start the webcam, detect faces, and update attendance records in real-time.

Run the GUI for Manual Management:

bash
Copy code
python studentmanagement.py
Use this GUI to manually add, update, or delete student records and export data to Excel.

⚙️ Customization Instructions
⏱️ Attendance Re-Update Condition
By default, the attendance system is set to allow re-marking of attendance after 30 seconds. This condition is defined on Line 114 of Main.py:

python
Copy code
if secondsElapsed > 30:
The value 30 represents the time in seconds after which attendance can be re-marked. Here’s how you can customize this setting according to your requirements:

To Allow Re-marking after 1 Hour:

Replace 30 with 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in 1 hour):
python
Copy code
if secondsElapsed > 3600:
To Allow Re-marking after 1 Day:

Replace 30 with 86400 (since there are 86400 seconds in 1 day):
python
Copy code
if secondsElapsed > 86400:
Explanation of the Re-Update Condition:
The variable secondsElapsed calculates the time difference in seconds between the current time and the last recorded attendance time for each student. The condition:

python
Copy code
if secondsElapsed > X:
checks if this time difference (secondsElapsed) exceeds the specified value X. When secondsElapsed is greater than X, the system allows the attendance to be marked again for that student. Adjusting the value of X lets you control the frequency of attendance updates:

Example 1: To re-mark attendance every 15 minutes, set X to 900 (since 15 minutes = 900 seconds).
Example 2: To re-mark attendance every 6 hours, set X to 21600 (since 6 hours = 21600 seconds).
Modify this setting according to your needs to ensure flexibility in attendance marking based on your institution's policies.
